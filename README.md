# quadcoptero
This project was developed as part of a final paper for my graduation in mechatronics engineering..
It consist in identify the mathematic model of my quadcopter, project the control using MATLAB and develop a c++ code 
to control the quad using an arduino ProMino board. I used the Atmel studio to develop this code due to several limitations of the arduino IDE. The tutorial to star programming arduino with atmel studio you can find here: http://www.engblaze.com/tutorial-using-atmel-studio-6-with-arduino-projects/
I will upload the entire project here, from the MATLAB code to arduino code and all the libraries i created. To find the library for the MPU i suggest this guy: http://davidegironi.blogspot.com.br/2013/02/avr-atmega-mpu6050-gyroscope-and.html#.VYduiEYpR1Q because was the only one i could make work with the atmel studio.
